Web browsers are getting more and more powerful. Now you can easily access the camera, and analyze the images.

Using only a browser, we will access the camera , using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications).

This code will capture still frames from the streaming video, and analyze the images and create a Motion Detection Web Application, using ONLY JavaScript.

The web app that will detect if there is motion, the direction, and the magnitude.
