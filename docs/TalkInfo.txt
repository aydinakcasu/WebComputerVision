I Told You to Stand Still ! (Motion Detection Web App with JavaScript)
Web browsers are getting more and more powerful.
Now you can easily access the camera, and analyze the images.

Using only a browser, we will access the camera ,
using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications).
We will capture still frames from the streaming video,
and analyze the images and create a Motion Detection Web Application,
using ONLY
JavaScript.

We will create an app that will detect if
there is motion,
the direction,
and the magnitude.

In this talk, Aydin Akcasu,
(who has over 10 years of prior experience in computer vision),
demonstrates how easy it is
to create a Motion Detector app,
using only JavaScript and just your web browser.

WevRTC
WebRTC is a free, open project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.

HTML5


getUserMedia() has been available since Chrome 21, Opera 18, and Firefox 17. Support was initially provided by the Navigator.getUserMedia() method, but this has been deprecated.

You should now use the navigator.MediaDevices.getUserMedia() method, which is widely supported.

The pace to find a suitable capture API accelerated thanks to the larger WebRTC (Web Real Time Communications) effort. That spec is overseen by the W3C WebRTC Working Group. Google, Opera, Mozilla, and a few others have implementations.

getUserMedia() is related to WebRTC because it's the gateway into that set of APIs. It provides the means to access the user's local camera/microphone stream.
